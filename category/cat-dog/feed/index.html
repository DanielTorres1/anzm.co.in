<p><strong>Onions and garlic:</strong> Both raw and cooked onions and garlic can destroy a cat&#8217;s red blood cells, leading to anemia.</p>



<p><strong>Chocolate:</strong> Contains theobromine and caffeine, which are toxic to <a href="https://www.lifewaytrove.com/why-is-my-cat-throwing-up-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cats throwing</a> and can cause heart problems, muscle tremors, and seizures.</p>



<p><strong>Alcohol:</strong> Can cause serious liver and brain damage. Even small amounts can be dangerous.</p>
