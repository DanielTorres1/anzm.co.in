<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-clean-with-vinegar-and-baking-soda"><strong>How to Clean with Vinegar and Baking Soda</strong></h2>



<p>Use vinegar and baking soda to tackle various cleaning tasks. Vinegar is a powerful disinfectant and grease cutter. Baking soda, on the other hand, helps remove stains or clean things and remove odors. These two elements form a clean front load washing machine duo and can be restored.</p>



<p><strong>Prepared:</strong> When cleaning your front load washer with vinegar and baking soda, make sure your washer line is unplugged first.</p>



<p><strong>Clean-Solution: </strong>Mix white vinegar and a little water in a bowl. Then, add 1/4 cup of baking soda to it. Add in such a way that the ingredients are well combined.</p>



<p><strong>Cleaning Door Seals:</strong> Focus on rubber door seals, which are a <a href="https://www.lifewaytrove.com/washing-machine-leaking-from-bottom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common causes</a> place for mold and bacteria to grow. Dip a clean front load washing machine cloth in the vinegar and water solution well and carefully wipe the door seal thoroughly. Alternatively, use an old toothbrush to clean the crevices and corners of the seal.</p>



<p><strong>Drum Cleaning:</strong> Pour the vinegar and water solution directly into the detergent or washer drum. Sprinkle the baking soda directly into the drum. Run a hot water cycle in the washer using the water level setting so that the vinegar and baking soda mixture is thoroughly cycled through the machine.</p>



<p><strong>Additional step:</strong> For stains or odors, the cleaning process you&#8217;ll need to repeat is to soak the vinegar and baking soda solution together in the drum for an extended period of time before running the hot water cycle. Then clean the inside of the drum with a cloth to remove the residue.</p>



<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Clean front load washing machine regularly with vinegar and baking soda. Clean the washer with vinegar and baking soda every month or as needed. That helps prevent mold and odor.</p>
