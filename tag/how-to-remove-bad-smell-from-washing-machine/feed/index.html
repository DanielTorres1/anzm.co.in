<p>By following these details and allowing for proper ventilation after each use, you can maintain a clean and odor-free washing machine while preventing the growth of mold and mildew.</p>



<p><strong>Using HE detergent: </strong>Using high-efficiency (HE) detergent in your bad smell from washing machine is important for optimal cleaning and maintenance. Here are some details to consider:</p>



<p><strong>Formulation:</strong> HE detergents are specially formulated to work with high-efficiency washing machines, which use less water than conventional models. They are designed to produce less suds, which helps prevent residue buildup and ensures thorough rinsing.</p>



<p><strong>Dosage:</strong> Follow the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions for the correct dosage of HE detergent based on the size of your load and soil level. Using too much detergent can result in excessive suds while using too little can result in insufficient cleaning.</p>



<p><strong>HE symbol:</strong> Look for the HE symbol on detergent packaging to ensure it is compatible with your high-efficiency bad smell from the washing machine. Using non-HE detergents in an HE machine can cause excessive siding and possible damage to the machine.</p>
