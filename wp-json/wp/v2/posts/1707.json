This step is crucial to ensuring that you reconnect the hoses correctly later on. Typically, the hot water hose is labeled with a red marker or the letter &#8220;H,&#8221; while the cold water hose is labeled with a blue marker or the letter &#8220;C.&#8221; If there are no labels, you can check the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions or follow the path of the hoses from the back of the washing machine to the water source.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"use-the-right-technique-to-loosen-hoses\"><strong>Use the Right Technique to Loosen Hoses<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve identified the hot and cold water hoses, it&#8217;s time to loosen them properly.

Here are some tips to ensure a smooth and secure move:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Disconnect the power supply. Begin by unplugging the washing machine from the electrical outlet. This will prevent any electrical mishaps during the moving process.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Turn off the water supply: Locate the water shut-off valve and turn it off to avoid any leaks or flooding while moving the machine.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Drain excess water: To prevent water spillage, empty the washing machine&#8217;s drum of any remaining water. This can be done by running a drain cycle or manually removing the water with a bucket or towels.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Secure the hoses: If your washing machine has hoses for water intake and drainage, make sure to secure them properly. Use zip ties or tape to keep the hoses in place and prevent any damage or leaks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Protect delicate parts: Cover the control panel, knobs, and any other delicate parts of the washing machine with bubble wrap or towels. This will provide an extra layer of protection against scratches or dents.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use proper lifting techniques: When lifting the washing machine, bend your knees and use your leg muscles instead of your back to avoid strain or injury. Enlist the help of a friend or family member to share the load and make the process easier.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Secure in a vehicle: Once the washing machine is in a vehicle, secure it by using straps or ropes to prevent any movement or tipping during transit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"How to Disconnect Your Washing Machine | ao.com\" width=\"1170\" height=\"658\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/iN4R-FqLg_I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By following these steps and taking the necessary precautions, you can safely move your washing machine to its new location without any hassle or damage.
